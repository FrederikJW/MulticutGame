# MulticutGame

MulticutGame is a game based on pygame to support the understanding of the multicut problem aka graph partition problem, correlation clustering, coalition structure generation. 
The multicut problem is an optimization problem, where an undirected weighted graph is cut into groups with the goal to minimize the sum of the weights of the cut edges. 
This game teaches about different types of graphs, the real world use case image segmentation and a non optimal solving algorithm greedy-joining.
